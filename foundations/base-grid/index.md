The following demo can be resized, to show how the grid adapts to different viewport sizes, by dragging its bottom-right corner. It is scaled down to half size.

This example is intended for illustration purposes only, and the HTML and CSS code used to create it should not be used.

{% include example-frame-base-grid.html name="interactive" caption="Half-scale interactive demo" resize=true %}
