## About the pattern

The ‘grid’ design separates a web page into individual content boxes.

## Components related to this

None

## Why we use this pattern

If a page contains lots of unrelated content, using a uniform grid layout can make it easier for users to browse a high number of content options than a less rigid design.  

The grid design can also make it easier for different designers or developers to work on the same page, as they can work on different sections of the grid.

## Demo

The following demo can be resized, to show how the grid adapts to different viewport sizes, by dragging its bottom-right corner. It is scaled down to half size.

This example is intended for illustration purposes only, and the HTML and CSS code used to create it should not be used.

{% include example-frame-base-grid.html name="interactive" caption="Half-scale interactive demo" resize=true %}
