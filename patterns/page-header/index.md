The page header contains the title (H1 element) of the content. It may also contain a [label](#) and some [metadata](/components/metadata) to provide further information about the content.

## Design rationale

Including a label to describe the type of content can give additional context to the content in cases where that would be helpful to the user.

Including important metadata in the header, such as whether an article has recently been updated, ensures that this information is easy for the user to discover.
