Sequential navigation is used at the bottom of content that is part of a sequence, for example a publication with multiple pages or an article with many sections. 

## Design rationale

The sequential navigation pattern helps users to navigate to different pages when they finish reading the content of the current page.
 
## Mobile variation

The navigation items are stacked vertically on small devices. The "next page" link appears first because it is the most likely to be needed by the user.
