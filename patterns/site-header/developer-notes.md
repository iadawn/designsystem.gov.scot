The site header will inherit its colour scheme from the colours you have defined for primary and secondary branding.

### Configuration options

Use the following modifier classes to alter the display of the site header:

`ds_site-header--gradient` changes the solid band across the top of the border to a gradient of your primary and secondary brand colours.

`ds_site-header--shadow` replaces the bottom border of the site header with a drop shadow

### Reversed variant

Use a class of `ds_reversed` on the header to reverse the colours of the site header and its subcomponents.
