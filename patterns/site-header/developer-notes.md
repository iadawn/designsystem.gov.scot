The site header will inherit its colour scheme from the colours you have defined for primary and secondary branding.

### Configuration options

Use the following modifier classes to alter the display of the site header:

`site-header--gradient` changes the solid band across the top of the border to a gradient of your primary and secondary brand colours.

`.site-header--reversed` uses a solid background colour (your primary brand colour) for the site header. This will require the use of the "reversed" modifier class on the header's subcomponents (`branding--reversed` and `site-search--reversed`).

`site-header--shadow` replaces the bottom border of the site header with a drop shadow
