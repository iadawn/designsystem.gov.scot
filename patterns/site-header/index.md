summary: "The site header tells users what site they are visiting and introduces any site branding. "
---

The site header appears on every page. It is placed at the top of the page and fills the full width of the browser window. It contains [site branding](/components/site-branding) and an optional [site search form](/components/site-search).

## Design rationale

The site header allows any user who has not come via the home page a means to identify the site they are using and a route to access the home page from anywhere on the site.

## Accessibility

Links in the site header have clear focus, hover and active states to meet accessibility requirements. Logos in the site header have meaningful alternative text.


## Alternative displays

### Solid background
{% include example-frame.html name="reversed" %}
