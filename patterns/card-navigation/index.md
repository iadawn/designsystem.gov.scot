Card navigation is a collection of [category item cards](/components/category-item-card/) presented in a grid. It is used as the top level of a set of navigation pages, with the cards giving greater visual prominence to the items in the navigation.

Items in the card navigation should be presented in a sensible order, with more important items closer to the top. If you do not have data or other insights to determine this importance, sort the items alphabetically.

## Design rationale

Cards provide greater visual prominence for options on the top level of navigation.

Presenting category items in a grid format makes the best use of available space in the page.

Providing the title and the summary of a piece of content helps users make the correct choice when faced with a number of content items in a navigation group. Reusing category items in multiple navigation patterns helps to create a consistent user experience.

## Responsive variations

The navigation is presented in a vertical list on small devices, and changes a two-column or three-column display on larger devices as space allows.
