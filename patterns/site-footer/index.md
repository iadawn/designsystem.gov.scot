## About this pattern
A site footer should include:

* an additional logo, if a parent or partner organisation’s logo is needed

* a list of links to items such as the privacy statement, cookie information and accessibility statement

* a copyright statement – for example, mygov.scot uses: “© Crown copyright. All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except for all graphic assets and otherwise stated.”  

## Why we use this pattern
Site footers are a best practice web pattern used to add information about a website at the bottom of web pages.

## Website analytics
Analytics evidence from mygov.scot and gov.scot shows that users are familiar with the logo as a route to the homepage. Users also interact with all the footer links.
