The category header contains the title (H1 element) of the category and a brief piece of content describing the category to help the user understand what the category is about. It can optionally include an image.

## Alternative display: coloured background

The category header can be given emphasis by placing it against a coloured background. If necessary to meet colour contrast requirements, it can be given white text.

The coloured background should span the width of the entire window and include the breadcrumbs.
