The components and patterns in this Design System have been designed and built to be compliant with WCAGAA 2.1.

Examples of where we have complied are:

- colour palette - e.g. contrast
- interactive elements - e.g. Accordion List, States
- hierarchy of heading structure for screen readers
- all content navigable without a mouse - i.e. via keyboard, joystick and assistive technologies
- images meaningfully described in alt-text
- icons have a text fall-back
- text styling, such as compliant indentation, size and spacing
- not reliant on colour cues, with an awareness of the accessibility needs for colour blindness
- ability to switch on/off captions in videos
- listing alternative accessible contact methods, such as text to speech services where possible
