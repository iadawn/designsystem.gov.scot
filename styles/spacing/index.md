The Design System uses an 8px grid for spacing and layout. This is a relatively common measure, for example it is also used in Google's [Material Design layout](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html).

All components on your web page ought to align to this grid. For design flexibility, items within components such as icons and type may use subdivisions of this grid for alignment where necessary, e.g. using a 4px or even 2px grid.
