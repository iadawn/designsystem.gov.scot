## Font 

If your service is going to be a subdomain of either gov.scot or mygov.scot then you must use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as your font.

We use the Roboto font, which is a free open source font developed by Google for use on screen. It has different weight options.




## Headings

Headings should be marked up semantically using the appropriate HTML heading element. Most websites use scaled headings to create a visual hierarchy of content.

The main headings on a website are usually "H1" size, with smaller sizes, such as H2 and H3, used for sub headings. Appropriate headings are helpful for accessibility, and help all users to understand your content. Search engines may make use of them to understand the content of your site.

We write headings in the same way as a normal sentence, with a capital letter at the start. The only difference is we don't use full stops. This is the most popular way of writing headings online and is known as "sentence case".

### Heading with captions

There are occasions when a heading is part of a larger section or group. To show this we use a heading with a caption, for example mygov.scot uses heading and caption on the "guide" format, and you can see how to implement this on the [page header](/components/page-header/) component.




## Paragraphs

### Body

The default paragraph font size used by the Design System is 19px on larger screens and 16px on smaller screens.

### Leader

Leader styling should apply to introductory content near the top of the page. The leader font size used by the Design System is 24px.

### Small

Small type should be used sparingly and when content is limited in space within a component.




## Links
Links styling is blue and underlined by default. If a link appears at the end of a sentence, the full stop should not be inside the link.




## Lists

Use lists to make blocks of text easier to read.

### Bulleted list

Introduce bulleted lists with a lead-in line ending in a colon. Start each item with a lowercase letter, and do not use a full stop at the end.

### Numbered list

Use numbered lists instead of bulleted lists when the order of the items is important. You do not need to use a lead-in line for numbered lists. Items in a numbered list should end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

### Contents list

A contents list might be used as a navigation aid at the top of each page in a set of related pages, such as in a "guide" format. It allows the user to identify their current position in the group of pages and to navigate between them.
