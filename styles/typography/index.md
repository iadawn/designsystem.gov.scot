## Font

You should use a font that’s clear on different screen sizes, viewports and browsers.

The font you choose should also have different weights, such as bold, heavy bold and light. Being able to use a font with different weights will allow you to define the typographical structure of your web content by more than just font size.

We use the Roboto font, which is an open source font developed by Google for use on screen. It has different weight options.

One of the reasons we use an open source font is because you do not need to buy a licence to use or edit an open source font. This helps reduce costs.

There are lots of open source fonts to choose from online, as well as licensed options.

Whatever font you choose you should test it with users before using it in a live project.

## Headings

Most websites use scaled headings to create a visual hierarchy of content.

The main headings on a website are usually ‘H1’ size, with smaller sizes, such as H2 and H3, used for sub headings.

You can also use a heavier weight, such as bold, to help a heading stand out.

We write headings in the same way as a normal sentence, with a capital letter at the start. The only difference is we don’t use full stops. This is the most popular way of writing headings online (news websites etc.) and is known as ‘sentence case’.

## Body copy

You should set a standard font size and style for body copy. This includes content contained in <p> tags or in other tags, such as <label>.

To make sure your font is clear on mobile devices, you’ll need to add a variety of sizes to your CSS.

You can take a look at WCAG Standards for more advice on typography minimum sizing.
