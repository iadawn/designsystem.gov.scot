## Size options

### Fixed-width inputs
{% include example-frame.html name="sizes-fixed" %}

### Fluid-width inputs
{% include example-frame.html name="sizes-fluid" %}




## Text input with an associated button

Sometimes buttons are directly related to an input field, such as in a [site search](/components/site-search) or [date picker](/components/date-picker).

{% include example-frame.html name="action" %}




## Currency text fields

If you are asking the user for a currency amount, use this version of a checkbox. It has a currency symbol that cannot be deleted by the user.

{% include example-frame.html name="currency" %}




## Inline text fields

In some cases it might be sensible to align text inputs inline, such as when asking for multiple short related fields.

{% include example-frame.html name="inline" %}
