### Configuration options

The link colour of the accordions' title text can be overridden, though blue is more commonly recognised as a link colour.

`$accordion__header-color`

Your value for this should be included before you include the SCSS file.

    $accordion__header-color: red;
    @import '/path/to/components/accordion/accordion';
