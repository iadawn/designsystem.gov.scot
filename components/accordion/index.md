## About this component

Multiple in-page links, indicated by ‘open/close’ arrow icons, allow users to open/close distinct sections of content.

Use of the accordion list should be based on user needs. For example, an accordion could be used when it’s expected users would only need to view one or two items from a longer list of distinct content options.

Some other things:
* opened content remains open until closed by the user, even when other content in the accordion list is opened
* an accordion list should not be nested inside another accordion list

## Components related to this

## Why we use this component
