## About this component

Multiple in-page links, indicated by ‘open/close’ arrow icons, allow users to open/close distinct sections of content.

Use of the accordion list should be based on user needs. For example, an accordion could be used when it’s expected users would only need to view one or two items from a longer list of distinct content options.

Other considerations:
* opened content remains open until closed by the user, even when other content in the accordion list is opened
* an accordion list cannot be nested inside another accordion list

## Why we use this component

When user needs clearly suggest that users will only need to select one or two small items of content from a longer list of options, the use of an accordion may help the user to choose the content they need quickly.

## Other versions of this component

There is an option to have an "Open all" and "Close all" function.

## Supporting evidence for using this component

There are no reported performance issues with this component from mygov or gov.scot.

## Website analytics and the use of this component

To understand user behaviour when using this component, the open/close arrow, or the "Open all"/"Close all" links can be tracked through the original page path.
