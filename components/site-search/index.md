## About this component
The site search component allows users to perform a content search in a site.

To search, users can either enter text in the search box and press return or trigger the magnifying glass icon.  

## Why we use this component
Site search is a commonly recognised component which allows users to quickly find the content they need from a site.  

Site search can be used in different contexts such as in the header of a site and in a larger form on search results pages.

## Mobile version
On mobile search can be minimised to only show the magnifying glass icon. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon reveals the search box.

## Supporting evidence for using this component
There are no reported performance issues with this component from mygov or gov.scot.

## Accessibility Features
The form field and magnifying glass button should include a text label which is hidden from visual browsers.  

The form should have a role of 'Search'.
