## About this component
To search, users can either enter text in the search box and press return or trigger the magnifying glass icon to the right of the search box.

On a mobile device, the search component minimises to only show the magnifying glass icon. Triggering the magnifying glass icon reveals the search box.

The site search component can be reused across a site, such as in a siteâ€™s header and on search results pages.

## Why we use this component
Site search is a commonly recognised component which allows users to quickly find the content they need on a site.

## Accessibility Features
The form field and magnifying glass button should include a text label which is hidden from visual browsers.  

The form should have a role of 'Search'.
