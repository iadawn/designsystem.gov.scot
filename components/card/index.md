## Design rationale

Cards provide a way to give greater visual prominence a component.

## Usage examples

### Arbitrary content

{% include example-frame.html name="content" %}

### A Design System component

This example demonstrates using a [metadata](/components/metadata) block on a card.

{% include example-frame.html name="component" %}


## An interactive component

Cards can house components that are interactive, such as [category items](components/category-item).

{% include example-frame.html name="interactive" %}
