## Design rationale

Cards provide a way to give greater visual prominence a component.

## Usage examples

### Arbitrary content

{% include example-frame.html name="content" %}

### A Design System component

This example demonstrates using a [metadata](/components/metadata) block on a card.

{% include example-frame.html name="component" %}


## Variant: no padding

The padding on a card can be removed enabling a component to fill the whole card. This is useful when you want the whole card to become clickable, such as when it contains a [category item](/components/category-item).

{% include example-frame.html name="no-padding" %}
