We use GOV.UK’s inset text component. [Find out more about the tag component on GOV.UK’s Design System](https://designsystem.gov.scot/components/tag/).

When we use the inset text component, we may alter minor things like colour or style – you can also customise GOV.UK’s inset text component for your own use.
