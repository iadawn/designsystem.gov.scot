## Why we use this component
The page header allows users who reach a page to understand what the content is about, and how current or up to date it is.  

Your title must be concise, descriptive and preferably 60 characters or less. Itâ€™s used by search engines and social media for indexing purposes. They generally only use the first 60 characters of a title.  

Your title should be tagged with an H1 heading. Using an H1 heading tag on the main title of content pages will help your website rank better.
