## About this component
The page header appears at the top of every page and is the main heading. It tells users what the page is about.   

The page header may include:
* a label showing the content type, such as a guide or article
* when the content item was first published and/or last updated

## Why we use this component
The page header allows users who reach a page to understand what the content is about, and how current or up to date it is.  

Your title must be concise, descriptive and preferably 60 characters or less. Itâ€™s used by search engines and social media for indexing purposes. They generally only use the first 60 characters of a title.  

Your title should be tagged with an H1 heading. Using an H1 heading tag on the main title of content pages will help your website rank better.
