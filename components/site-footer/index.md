## About this component
The site footer appears at the bottom of every page of a website. It highlights additional important and required information. For example:
* an optional additional logo if a parent or similar organisation's logo is needed
* a list of links to items such as the privacy statement, cookie information and accessibility statement
* a copyright statement – for example, Mygov sites use: "© Crown copyright. All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except for all graphic assets and otherwise stated."    

## Why we use this component
Site footers are a standard web pattern used to add information and navigation options at the bottom of web pages.

## Other versions of this component
Site footer without logo.  

## Supporting evidence for using this component
Analytics evidence from mygov.scot and gov.scot shows that users are familiar with the logo as a route to the homepage.
