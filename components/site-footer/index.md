## About this component
The site footer appears at the bottom of every page of a website. It highlights key information. For example:
* any logos extra to the main site logo in the header
* a list of links
* a dividing line
* a copyright statement – such as "© Crown copyright. All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except for all graphic assets and otherwise stated."  

Any other elements for the site footer should be included in a secondary footer.
