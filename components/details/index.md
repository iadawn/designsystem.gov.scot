{:.info-note.caution}
This is an experimental component and a fallback is required for Edge and Internet Explorer.

### Note:

Consider fallbacks and accessibility. Tabindex and role attributes on the summary should only be added where the <code>details</code> element has support (currently not Edge or IE). The aria-expanded attribute should only be added when JavaScript is available to toggle it correctly.
