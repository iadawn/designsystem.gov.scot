We use GOV.UK’s warning text component. [Find out more about the warning text component on GOV.UK’s Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/).

When we use the warning text component, we may alter minor things like colour or style – you can also customise GOV.UK’s component for your own use.
