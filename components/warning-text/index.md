## Website analytics
Each link in warning notes should be given a data attribute to help with tracking.

To understand user behaviour, clicks on links in warning notes can be tracked through the click URL, the click text and a data attribute showing the interaction, for example. <code>data-navigation="warning-link"</code>.
