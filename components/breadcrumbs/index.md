## When to use this component
Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.

## When not to use this component
Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.

## How it works
If the breadcrumbs component includes the user's current page it should:
* be visually distinct from the other items in the breadcrumb trail
* be marked as the current page for screen readers
* not be a link.
