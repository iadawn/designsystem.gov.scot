## About this component
A notification banner always goes across the top of a page and spans its full width. Notification banners should only be used for a small amount of content that all users need to see. A banner should also push anything else on the page beneath it.  

If users need to know more, a link in the banner should link to further content.  

You should try to avoid having more than 2 notification banners on a page. If you have more than 1 banner, each banner should be distinct.  

Each banner should also allow the user to remove the banner from the page, usually by having a ‘close’ link or an ‘X’. If the user closes a banner, a cookie should be set logging that the banner shouldn’t appear again in the browser. Because of this, each banner will need a unique ID.  

Generally, banners do not contain images, but may contain small icons, such as an arrow to highlight a link.  

Banners can be set as ‘sticky’ when there is a user need for the banner not to disappear if the user scrolls the page. This can be the case if the message is deemed more important than a normal banner, such as if the message is about a national emergency.
