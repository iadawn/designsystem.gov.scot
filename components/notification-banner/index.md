## About this component

The notification banner stretches across the top of a web page, spanning its full width. It pushes everything else on a web page beneath it.

Links to further content can be included in the banner.

You should try to avoid having more than 2 notification banners on a page. If you have more than 1 banner, each banner should be distinct.

Each banner should also allow the user to remove the banner from the page, usually by having a ‘close’ link or an ‘X’. If the user closes a banner, a cookie should be set logging that the banner shouldn’t appear again in the browser. Because of this, each banner will need a unique ID.

Generally, banners do not contain images, but may contain small icons, such as an arrow to highlight a link.

## Why we use this component

To highlight short, key content at the top of the page that all users need to see.

## Website analytics

User research findings from GOV.UK and NHS suggests that banners which overlay or hide content on a page leads to a worse user experience (higher exit rate).
