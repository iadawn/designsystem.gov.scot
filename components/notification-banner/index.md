## About this component
A notification banner always goes across the top of a page and spans its full width. Notification banners should only be used for a small amount of content that all users need to see. A notification banner should also push anything else on the page beneath it.  

If users need to know more, the notification banner should link to further content.  

You should try to avoid having more than 2 notification banners on a page.  

Each notification banner should also allow the user to remove the banner from the page, usually by having a ‘close’ link or an ‘X’. If the user closes a notification banner, a cookie should be set logging that the notification banner shouldn’t appear again in the browser. Because of this, each banner will need a unique ID.  

Generally, notification banners do not contain images, but may contain small icons, such as an arrow to highlight a link.  

Notification banners can be set as ‘sticky’ when there is a user need for the banner not to disappear if the user scrolls the page. This can be the case if the message is deemed more important than a normal banner, such as if the message is about a national emergency.

## Why we use this component
To highlight short, key content at the top of the page that all users need to see.  

## Supporting evidence for using this component
User research findings from GOV.UK and NHS suggests that banners which overlay or hide content lead to users leaving the page.
