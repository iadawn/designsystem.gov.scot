## About the pattern

The ‘card’ navigation pattern is a three column grid that separates uniform boxes. These boxes should contain links to the next level of navigation or to content.

The card navigation pattern is:
* the first level of navigation on the site
* flexible – it can be used with any number of content items and the cards in the grid can be sorted in any order, although it’s sensible to base how you order the boxes on user needs

## Components related to this

* Category item – a component that makes up second level navigation pages, along with category header
* Grid navigation – pattern used to structure category items on a page
* List navigation – third level navigation page

## Why we use this component

The large size of the cards in the card navigation pattern allows enough space for content that previews the next level of navigation or content.
It also creates a consistent navigational pattern for content.
