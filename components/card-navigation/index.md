## About this component

We use three main types of navigational pages:

* Box navigation - displays hyperlinked headings and summary content in rows of large boxes on desktops and tablets, a single column on mobile
* Grid navigation - orders hyperlinked headings and summary content into rows without boxes on desktops and tablets, a single column on mobile
* List navigation - orders hyperlinked headings and summary content into a list

### Box navigation

All boxes should contain links.

Single boxes can be ‘highlighted’ to make them stand out from others on the page.

### Grid navigation

Although there are no boxes, there is a single, left-hand side line running the total length of each text area (heading plus summary content).

### List navigation

Links in a navigational list can be highlighted. Links that are highlighted always appear at the top of the list. Other items in the list may be sorted in any order.

## Other versions of these components

Some versions of box navigation may include a gradient effect along the bottom border of individual boxes.

## Why we use these components

Features of these components, such as the large size of the boxes in the box navigation component, help space out content to make it easier for users to find the content they need.

These components can also be reused across websites, creating a consistent experience for users and cutting development time.
