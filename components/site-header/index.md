## About this component

The site header introduces wider site branding, such as the main colours in a site’s colour palette. It appears at the top of every page and can include an optional search field and primary site navigation.

On a mobile, site navigation is hidden from view until the user clicks or taps on a ‘menu’ button.

1.	Plain header
2.	Plain header with logo and site title
3.	Header with search
4.	Header with site navigation

## Why we use this component

The site header is ‘sticky’, which means it stays at the top of a browser window even when a user scrolls a page. This means users can navigate to key pages and access a site’s search box without having to get back to the top of a page.

It also helps a user quickly recognise a website, for example if they don’t come to a website via a homepage, or they have multiple tabs open and are switching back and forth between tabs.

We’ve avoided using second level interactive navigation because of usability concerns.

## Website analytics

Analytics evidence from mygov.scot and gov.scot shows that users are familiar with the logo as a route to the homepage.

Users were also more likely to navigate to site sections of gov.scot using the site header’s primary navigation than using the same links on panels lower down the homepage.

## Accessibility features

* Links in the header, including branding, need to have clear focus and hover states to meet accessibility requirements.
* Branded images used within the headers should have meaningful alternative text.
* The search box in the header should include all the accessibility features of standard forms but there’s no need to include error messaging. Error messages can be moved into the search results page.
