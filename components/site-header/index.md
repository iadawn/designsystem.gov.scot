## About this component
The site header tells users what site they are visiting and introduces site branding. It appears at the top of every page and can include an optional search field and primary navigation.

## Components related to this
Search field
Primary navigation
Phase label

## Why we use this component
The site header means users can navigate pages without having to go back to the top of the page.

Having primary navigation, or search, in the header also gives users a way of getting their bearings in the site and allows easy access to other parts of the site.

It also means users who have not come via the homepage have a way to identify which site they’re on.

We’ve avoided using second level interactive navigation because of usability concerns.

## Other versions of this component
1.	Plain header
2.	Plain header with logo and site title
3.	Header with search
4.	Header with primary navigation
5.	Header with search and primary navigation
6.	Header with Phase Label  

## Mobile version
Navigation links may form part of an expandable. This is represented in the header by a burger /menu icon.

## Supporting evidence for using this component
None.  

## Website analytics and the use of this component
Analytics evidence from mygov.scot and gov.scot shows that users are familiar with the logo as a route to the homepage.

Users were more likely to navigate to site sections of gov.scot using the primary site navigation in the header, rather than using homepage panel items (Google Analytics, July 2019)  

## Accessibility Features
* Links in the header including the branding need to have clear focus and hover states to meet accessibility requirements. (link to separate page explaining why this is important)
* Branded images used within the headers should have meaningful alternative text. (link to separate page explaining why this is important)
* Also need to cover keyboard triggers
* Search forms in the header should include all the accessibility features for forms as outlined in.
* There’s no need to include error messaging in the form field. This can be moved into the search results page.
* Include a ‘Skip to main content’ link. Ideally this is visible as it can be of value to a broad range of users.
