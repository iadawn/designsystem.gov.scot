Category item is a simple component that is used to populate collections of items in a navigation pattern, such as [grid navigation](/patterns/grid-navigation) or [list navigation](/patterns/list-navigation). It is never used on its own.

## Design rationale

Providing a the title and the summary of a piece of content helps users make the correct choice when faced with a number of content items in a navigation group.

Reuse of the category item component across a number of wider patterns helps to create consistency.

## Alternative displays

### Highlight
Category items can be highlighted.
{% include example-frame.html name="highlight" caption="Example of a highlighted category item" %}

### Without left border
Category items can have the left border removed.
{% include example-frame.html name="no-border" caption="Example of a category item with no left border" %}


### TEMP SMORGASBORD

{% include example-frame.html name="smorgasbord" caption="All variants in a single example for demo" %}
