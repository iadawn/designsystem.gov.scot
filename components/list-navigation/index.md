List navigation is a collection of [category items](/components/category-item/) presented in a list. 

List navigation can include a highlighted section to call attention to important items. The highlighted section should be at the top of the navigation.

Items in the list should be presented in a sensible order, with more important items closer to the top. If you do not have data or other insights to determine this importance, sort the items alphabetically.

## Design rationale

Providing the title and the summary of a piece of content helps users make the correct choice when faced with a number of content items in a navigation group. Reusing category items in multiple navigation patterns helps to create a consistent user experience.
