## About this component

The cookie banner checks with users whether they’re OK with cookies being used on their device. If user selects ‘accept cookies’, the user’s choice is confirmed in a new banner and the cookie banner will not be shown again in this user’s browser. If the user is not OK with cookies being used, the user can select a link to a page telling them how to carry on using the site without cookies. If the user does not select either option, the cookie banner remains on the page, and will appear on any new pages the user visits.  

Also:

* if user accepts cookies, a cookie is placed on the user’s browser which stops the banner appearing again
* cookie banner should not contain a logo
* cookie banner should always appear above any other banners on the page
