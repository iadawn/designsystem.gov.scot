## About this component
Sequential navigation is displayed at the bottom of content pages where there’s a clear next or previous page, such as a step-by-step guide spread over several web pages.

If it’s the first page of content, the ‘previous’ link will not show. If it’s the last page, the ‘next’ link will not show.

On mobile, the ‘next’ link displays stacked above the ‘previous’ link.

## Why we use this component
Sequential navigation allows users to navigate without having to go back to navigational links at the top of a page.

## Website analytics
Analytics shows sequential navigation is used by users across mygov.scot and gov.scot, especially on mobile devices, where it is more prominent than other forms of navigation.
