## About this component
Contact details is a component that gives a consistent way to display the contact details of an organisation within a website’s content. It can include links to an organisation’s email, social media and other direct contact details.  

When using the pattern, you should make sure:
* the order of the contact details are based on user needs, with the most used content format at the top
* only one email address is given  

Social media logos are included to help make social media addresses more recognisable to users.

## Why we use this component
Giving contact details their own distinct design pattern, separate from the rest of the content on a web page, can help users to quickly find contact details when they need to. The recognisable format of contact details helps users to skip past this content if they don’t need it.

## Supporting evidence for using this component

Around 3% of internal searches on mygov.scot are for contact details.

Contact details components can also be returned by Google in ‘smart search’ results. As an example, about four times the number of users find Disclosure Scotland’s contact details from the mygov website in a Google ‘smart search’ results page than they do on mygov.  

## Website analytics and the use of this component

To track this component:
* clicks on social media/email/telephone links can be tracked through the original page path, the external link URL/mailto/tel, the click text and a data attribute showing the element, e.g. data-navigation=“contact-details”
* internal links (e.g. for telephone number charges) can be tracked using the same attributes
* phone numbers are not links by default – they are tagged with a data attribute and, if the user is on a mobile phone, can be automatically linked to make a call, if the user’s browser supports this
