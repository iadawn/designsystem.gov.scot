## About this component
The side navigation is a list of links to other parts of the same web page or to other pages. It sits alongside the page content.

A side navigation can be made up of a flat or nested list of links.

The side navigation will highlight the page in the list that the user is on and each link should take the user to distinct content.  

If the side navigation has a structure with nested sections, it should:
* display all the pages in a section when a user selects the section
* stay under 10 sections
* have no more than 3 levels in total, i.e. side navigation>nested section> nested section  

The side navigation should also:
* not repeat or be combined with grid navigation pages
* not include icons
* include a limited character count for links to avoid spanning over too many lines

## Why we use this component
The side navigation gives users a snapshot of content within the user’s current website, as well as it sits in terms of the whole website.

Since it’s on the left hand side of the page, it also supports left to right reading.

## Mobile version
The mobile version of side navigation is minimised into an expandable list at the top of the page.

## Supporting evidence for using this component
There are no reported performance issues with this component from mygov or gov.scot.

## Website analytics and the use of this component
To understand user behaviour, clicks on side navigation items can be tracked through the original page path, the click URL, the click text and a data attribute showing the item, e.g. data-navigation=“sidenav-1-1”  

An additional data attribute would be used to track clicks on mobile, e.g. data-navigation="sidenav-open"  

## Accessibility features
Aria attributes describe whether the side navigation is open or closed.
