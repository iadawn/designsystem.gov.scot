## About this component
Site navigation arranges key links into a row and should go at the top of a website.

Links may be collapsed into an expandable ‘menu’ button on mobiles.

## Why we use this component
Top level navigation gives users an overview of what’s included in a site by outlining its main categories.

It can also help users find key content quicker.
