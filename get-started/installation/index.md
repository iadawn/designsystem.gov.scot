## Include the Design System in your project

To use the Design System's styles and components you have to include the Design System in your project.

There are two ways of including it:
* Install the Design System source using npm (Node.js package manager)
* Include the compiled Design System files in your project

### 1. Installing using npm

This is the preferred way of including the Design System. It is easier to stay up to date with any additions or bug fixes, and gives you some additional customisation options. See the instructions for [installing with npm](/get-started/installation/npm/).

You can:
* choose to include only the CSS and JavaScript for the components that you are using
* build your own components using the palette and other base styles in the Design System
* customise the output by overriding variables set in the components, for example specifying your own brand colours to use

### 2. Including compiled files

If you are not using npm in your project, you can use the precompiled stylesheets and JavaScript for the Design System. You will have more limited options this way and it will be more difficult to customise or add to the components for your project.
