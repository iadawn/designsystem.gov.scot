Youâ€™ll need to [set up your project](/get-started/installation/) to be able to use our Design System. 

## Accessibility

We've created the Design System with accessibility as a key requirement. Every [style](/styles/), [component](/components/) and [pattern](/patterns/) passes WGAC&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;AA.

## User research

Where it's helpful, we've included details about user research and how the styles, components and patterns have met user needs.
