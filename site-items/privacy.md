Google Analytics data is only collected from users who have consented to share this data. Any information we get about you from Google Analytics will be anonymised before we see it. This means we will not hold any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or address.

## Why we collect this information

We use the information you share with us:

Our legal basis for processing this data is 'legitimate interests'. That's because:

* sell or give your data to third parties

## How long we keep your information

We will delete any feedback you share with us after 3 years. We keep anonymised analytics for 38 months.
